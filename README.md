# üß† Face Recognition System in Python

A Python-based face recognition system capable of detecting and recognizing human faces in images or real-time video using computer vision and deep learning techniques.

## üìå Features

- Face detection using Haar Cascades or deep learning models
- Face recognition using LBPH, FaceNet, or Dlib
- Real-time recognition via webcam
- Image-based recognition from static photos
- Support for adding new known faces to the system
- Logging of recognition events (optional)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Dlib / FaceNet / face_recognition (choose based on what you used)
- Tkinter (if GUI used)
- SQLite / CSV / JSON (for storing known faces metadata)
